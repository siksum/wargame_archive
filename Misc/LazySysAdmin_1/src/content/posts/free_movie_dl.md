## Have you heard of NetsSflix

Netsflix is one example of a subscription service that lets you save its movies and TV shows to a download portion of the app so you can watch even without wifi.


As someone who has been using NetsSflix for a long time, it's my top choice for saving movies offline. If you don't use Netflix, there are several other similar options listed below.

Downloads are allowed through the Netsflix app for iOS, Android, and Windows.

Visit the [Netflix](https://nestflix.fun/) website!
