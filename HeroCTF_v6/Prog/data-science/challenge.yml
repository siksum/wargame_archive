description: "Here is a database of sells on a online marketplace. Your job as a data analyst is to answer the following questions :<br>
1. If at 2019-12-31 (at the beginning) every person has 10000$, who has the most money by 2023-01-01 (transaction of that day **excluded**)?<br>
2. By 2023-01-01 (transaction of that day **excluded**) how much money was spared through discounts?<br>
3. By 2023-01-01 (transaction of that day **excluded**) how many people have a negative balance?<br>
<br><br>
Here are some information about the database fields:<br>
| Field name | Data type  | Constraints             |<br>
|------------|------------|-------------------------|<br>
| order_id   | integer    | 1 < order_id < 1 000 000  |<br>
| buyer_id   | integer    | 1 < buyer_id < 1 000 000  |<br>
| seller_id  | integer    | 1 < seller_id < 1 000 000 |<br>
| price      | integer    | 1 < price < 10 000      |<br>
| discount   | integer    | 0 < discount < 100      |<br>
| date       | date       | yyyy-mm-dd              |<br>
<br><br>
Additionally, you should know that Buyers and Sellers are reprensted by a unique ID and are correlated. Buyer 163564 is the same person as Seller 163564.<br>
<br><br>
Prices should be **floored** to the nearest integer, but only at the final stage of the calculation.<br>
<br><br>
e.g. If there are two discounts bringing prices down from 10 and 5 to 8.64 and 4.32 respectively, the amount of money spared is 10 + 5 - 8.64 - 4.32 = 2.04 ~= 2. As you can see, the only rounding operation was done on the very last value, used in the flag.<br>
<br><br>
The flag is Hero{response1_response2_reponse3}.<br>
<br><br>
e.g. Hero{163564_21673_78}<br>
