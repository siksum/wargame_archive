description: "In this challenges, you will have to code your own bot, that will control an ant colony.
<br>
In the two first challenges (easy and medium), you will compete against my bots. If you succeed, you will enter the PVP arena, to compete against other players.
<br>
10min before the CTF's end, scoring will stop, and the team with the most points will be awarded a flag worth 10 points. It might not be much, but it could mean the different between a second or first place ;)
<br>
Find out more about the game in the documentation section of the dedicated plateform!
<br>
It's worth noting that the goal of the challenges is not to exploit the plateform, but to create the best bot possible. Anyone finding a security failure is welcome to report it, but any challenge solved through such a vulnerability would be rendered void.
<br>
You can find the source code of the game engine with the first challenge of the series, would you want to it up locally.
